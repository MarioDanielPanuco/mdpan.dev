## About Me 
Hello there! I'm Mario Daniel Panuco. I recently finished a Masters student in Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics at UCSC. My undergraduate years in Computer Science spiked my interest in Scientific Computing, Machine Learning, and Computational Genomics.

Outside of academia, my interests are in competitive esports and digital/analog sound design (it's all sines and cosines!!).
