## About Me 
Hello there! I'm Mario Daniel Panuco. I recently finished my Masters in Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics at UCSC. During my Computer Science undergraduate, I found interest in algorithmns and machine learning, I'm glad I got to expand on these interests during my Masters. I'm currently focusing on Scientific Machine Learning, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and Computational Genomics.
