## My favorite talks/moments

### Entangled
While not a talk focused much on Rust, this was my first introduction into the concept of \_. I believe this approach to software engineering has benefits mainly to research lab environments, rather than tech companies. Due to the ability to properly document code while writing the software itself. The most comparable programming experience this programming paradigm would be development through Jupyter notebooks, however, I have issues with Jupyter notebooks. I believe, outside of data science, Jupyter notebooks are mainly a powerful educational tool, rather than a development tool. 

###  Cfsem
This talk is one I'll have to go back to. Very interesting topic in the field of fusion. I wonder if there are applications of my research into Neural Operators in this field.

## Takeaways
This workshop inspired me to go ahead and start implementing some of my scientific computing knowledge and skills in Rust. My previous experience with is sums up to utilizing the language as a general swiss-army knife for software engineering. Essentially like a lower-level Python that can handle anything from systems programming to web-development. Up to this point, I didn't believe that it would be optimal approach scientific research with a rust-first approach. Now I believe the overhead of time-spent on writing scientific computing applications in Rust is worth the time spent over something like Python. Note just for a performance benefit, but for the overall developer experience with the Rust Cargo tool-chain.
