# Preface 
In certain concerns, the current iteration of techno-political activism parellels the former techno-political movements such as the Free-Software, Open-Source, Linux, and privacy movements of the 1990s and 2000s. Where these movements differ highlights some critical differences in ideology and goals. 


## Productivity
## Singularity 
Whereas the movements hitherto mentioned have been sidelined by the mainstream political consciousness, for reasons such as: distancy to immediete grievences to the material conditions of the American working-class, acceptance of lose to intelligence agencies, and being co-opted in the panick of big-tech's monopoly on information. New techno-political movements are fueled by looking uncertainty of the "technological singularity." Good-faith actors which to ensure humanity doesn't make the same mistakes seem in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century; bad-faith actors which to get ahead of policy that will define the next era of humanity and carve space for themselves. 

The latter can in their most \_ can be identified as which already hold a great share of poltical and economic power in America and seek to maintain and expand such influence. Some examples are: tech CEOs and Venture Capitalists who have sqeezed their way into house oversight commitees such as the commitee on transportation, commitee on energy, and notably the newly emerging compitte on \_. This class also ensures their influence through the funding and support of political candidates in agreement, or willing to cowtow, to their ideological goals. Some examples are, Peter Thiel's support of political candidates such as Blake Master's failed campaign and successfully J.D. Vance's congressional race and subsiquent involvement in his appointmenship in Donald Trump's proposed 2024 administration as Vice President, CEOs of tech giants (Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Amazon) in the commitee of .


[Marc Andression's "Little Tech" Article](https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/): 
This article proposes well-meaning policies to strengthen America's technological and economic sectors, but in the purpose of sustaining and expanding American global hegemony over "hostile" China. In my view, the Chinese policies that have hurt western influence are not hostile, on the contrary they are defensive. For example, the belton road initialive seeks out to strengthen China through supoprting Chinese propserity in it's economic and technological sectors and extending this prosperity to it's allies. This is in opposition to America's policies which are to invenst and strengthen the military industral conflict in worry of a Chinese attach on America or it's allies. In my view, this American policy will lead to a conflict with China because it prepares for it, rather than pursuing policies that avoid a conflict all-together. "If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
# Present
## Factions
I propose that current techno-political movements split into categories that often overlap but splinter in key-goals and ideology: 
- Techno-Optimists 
- Effective Accelerationists (E/Acc) - Beff Jezos, Eigenbot, 
- Decelerationists (Decel)
- American Dynimists

Notably prominant E/Acc influencers on X are in support of reactionary political ideologies such as: 
- Israel's siege on Gaza
- Anti-DEI retoric
- Anti-immigration (despite many of it's members being recipents of H1B or student visas)

The anti-immigration retoric, in my opinion, is a reaction to the moral panic over immigrants "invading" the country and seeking to destroy cohesion of American values. I find this in opposition to the defining principals of America's founding and in ingnorance to the policies that have brought upon vast immigration into the country over the southern border. I don't see immigrants as sinister beings seeking to carve out America for themselves, I see the immigration crisis as a respose to America's failure over decades to inact proper immigration procedures and it's policy of destabilizing the global south. I understand concern over the southern border as many families and children are exploited in their journey to America, which in honesty is "sometimes" acclogied by anti-immigration reactionaries, but often as means of further solidying calls to shut down the border. Facts are that we've already been doing this for decades and the sitation has only gotten worse. Increasing the penalty for illiegal immigration doesn't clot the problem, much like banning particular weapons doesn't solve the gun violence problem in America. I agree with most Americans in that we need stronger federal gun license oversight, in addition to imporving the disfunctional material conditions that fuel extremism. When I say "more gun laws," this isn't in sentimant with strengthening of the ATF or local police departments, it just means introducing more friction into the gun purchase process. 

I don't mean to use reactionary in the derogotory way that it has diffused into in political online circles, but in it's pure ideological meaning. That is to say a reactionary is in support many of the same opinions that are first reported by the mainstream media, they don't dig into deeper implications of the tangeble effects the politics they support. For example, they see ex-CIA influencers on podcasts speak on China and their first-instinct of an emerging anti-china candidate is to consider them a patriot in America's battle to strengthen it's weining influence on the global south over the emerging China through military intervention, critic, and sanctions.

## Elon Musk's Purchase Of Twitter
Elon Musk purchased Twitter on  and subsequently renamed the platform as "X." 


Curiously enough, various "tech" centered accounts have sprung up in the wake of . 
- Israel's siege on Gaza
- Tech-accelerationism subservant to anti-decelerationists 
- Emergence of a new economy spearheaded by Venture-Capital
- 

Whether these opinions are genuine is a matter of political
