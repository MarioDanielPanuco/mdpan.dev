# Preface 
In certain concerns, the current iteration of techno-political activism parallels the former techno-political movements such as the Free-Software, Open-Source, Linux, and privacy movements of the 1990s and 2000s. Where these movements differ highlights some critical differences in ideology and goals. 

## History 
The 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of several influential techno-political movements, driven by a desire for greater transparency, user freedom, and privacy. The Free-Software movement, spearheaded by figures like Richard Stallman, advocated for software that could be freely used, modified, and distributed. This philosophy underpinned the development of the GNU Project and the General Public License (GPL), which sought to protect user freedoms and ensure that software remained open and collaborative.

The Open-Source movement, closely related to Free-Software, gained prominence with the launch of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) in 1998. Prominent projects like the Linux operating system, developed by Linus Torvalds, exemplified the power of collaborative development and the potential for open-source software to challenge proprietary systems. These movements emphasized community-driven innovation and resisted the monopolistic tendencies of large software corporations.

Privacy movements also gained traction during this period, responding to growing concerns about surveillance and data collection by both governments and private companies. Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and initiatives like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption championed the right to privacy and the importance of secure communications.



## Productivity
Measuring American prosperity in terms of productivity has long been a cornerstone of economic analysis. However, the advent of a post-scarcity economy—where technological advancements reduce the cost of goods and services to near-zero—poses new challenges and opportunities for American influence. This shift impacts traditional economic metrics and necessitates a reevaluation of what constitutes prosperity in an era where material scarcity is no longer a primary concern.


## Singularity 
Whereas the movements hitherto mentioned have been sidelined by the mainstream political conscousness, for reasons such as: distancy to immediate grievances to the material conditions of the American working-class, acceptance of lose to intelligence agencies, and being co-opted in the panic of big-tech's monopoly on information. New techno-political movements are fueled by looking uncertainty of the "technological singularity." Good-faith actors which to ensure humanity doesn't make the same mistakes seem in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century; bad-faith actors which to get ahead of policy that will define the next era of humanity and carve space for themselves. 

The latter can in their most \_ can be identified as which already hold a great share of political and economic power in America and seek to maintain and expand such influence. Some examples are: tech CEOs and Venture Capitalists who have squeezed their way into house oversight committees such as the committee on transportation, committee on energy, and notably the newly emerging committee on \_. This class also ensures their influence through the funding and support of political candidates in agreement, or willing to cowtow, to their ideological goals. Some examples are, Peter Thiel's support of political candidates such as Blake Master's failed campaign and successfully J.D. Vance's congressional race and subsequent involvement in his appointment in Donald Trump's proposed 2024 administration as Vice President, CEOs of tech giants (Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Amazon) in the committee of .



[Marc Andression's "Little Tech" Article](https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/): 
This article proposes well-meaning policies to strengthen America's technological and economic sectors, but in the purpose of sustaining and expanding American global hegemony over "hostile" China. In my view, the Chinese policies that have hurt western influence are not hostile, on the contrary they are defensive. For example, the belton road initiative seeks out to strengthen China through supporting Chinese prosperity in it's economic and technological sectors and extending this prosperity to its' allies. This is in opposition to America's policies which are to invest and strengthen the military industrial conflict in worry of a Chinese attach on America or it's allies. In my view, this American policy will lead to a conflict with China because it prepares for it, rather than pursuing policies that avoid a conflict all-together. "If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
# Present
## Factions
I propose that current techno-political movements split into categories that often overlap but splinter in key-goals and ideology: 
- Techno-Optimists 
- Effective Accelerationists (E/Acc) - Beff Jezos, Eigenbot, 
- Decelerationists (Decel)
- American Dynimists

Notably prominant E/Acc influencers on X are in support of reactionary political ideologies such as: 
- Israel's siege on Gaza
- Anti-DEI retoric
- Anti-immigration (despite many of it's members being recipents of H1B or student visas)

The anti-immigration rhetoric, in my opinion, is a reaction to the moral panic over immigrants "invading" the country and seeking to destroy cohesion of American values. I find this in opposition to the defining principals of America's founding and in ingnorance to the policies that have brought upon vast immigration into the country over the southern border. I don't see immigrants as sinister beings seeking to carve out America for themselves, I see the immigration crisis as a respose to America's failure over decades to inact proper immigration procedures and it's policy of destabilizing the global south. I understand concern over the southern border as many families and children are exploited in their journey to America, which in honesty is "sometimes" acknowledged by anti-Immigration reactionaries, but often as means of further solidying calls to shut down the border. Facts are that we've already been doing this for decades and the sitation has only gotten worse. Increasing the penalty for illiegal immigration doesn't clot the problem, much like banning particular weapons doesn't solve the gun violence problem in America. I agree with most Americans in that we need stronger federal gun license oversight, in addition to imporving the disfunctional material conditions that fuel extremism. When I say "more gun laws," this isn't in sentimant with strengthening of the ATF or local police departments, it just means introducing more friction into the gun purchase process. 

I don't mean to use reactionary in the derogotory way that it has diffused into in political online circles, but in it's pure ideological meaning. That is to say a reactionary is in support many of the same opinions that are first reported by the mainstream media, they don't dig into deeper implications of the tangeble effects the politics they support. For example, they see ex-CIA influencers on podcasts speak on China and their first-instinct of an emerging anti-china candidate is to consider them a patriot in America's battle to strengthen it's weining influence on the global south over the emerging China through military intervention, critic, and sanctions.

## Elon Musk's Purchase Of Twitter
Elon Musk purchased Twitter and rebranded it as "X," catalyzing the emergence of various "tech"-centered accounts. These accounts often promote tech-accelerationism, opposition to decelerationist views, and a new economy led by venture capital. Whether these opinions are genuine or strategically motivated is a matter of political debate.


Curiously enough, various "tech" centered accounts have sprung up in the wake of . 
- Israel's siege on Gaza 
- Tech-accelerationism subservient to anti-decelerationists 
- Emergence of a new economy spearheaded by Venture-Capital
- 

Whether these opinions are genuine is a matter of political 


# Future


## What Are Peter Thiel's Goals?
Being that I grew up in the Bay Area, I've been following Peter Thiel's story since I was 16 years old. I find his insight to be historically valuable, but not morally-correct. What do I mean by this? His advise and philosophy to life/Venture-Capital works, but not because he's envisioning a better world. His insight is pragmatic and lateral, but rife with internal contradictions common for whatever time he's being quoted from. For example, a future where Palantir, Thiel's private intelligence tech-company, prospers isn't the divine future one seeks. But through accepting the reality of a world that brings about the creating of such a company, one can learn to maneuver reality and maybe bend this future to something that aligns with our interests. I think understanding this about Thiel's worldview gives sense to his actions. Why would Thiel, as a gay man, give millions to extreme political candidates that publicly speak out against his sexual orientation? Well, ..., because in the long-run he's shielded from any tangible persecution resultant form such rhetoric.
